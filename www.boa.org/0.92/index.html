<h1>Boa</h1>

Welcome to the home page for Boa, a high performance web server for
Unix-alike computers, covered by the <a href="Gnu_License.html">Gnu General
Public License</a>.  The current release is boa-0.92r.

<p>Despite some indications to the contrary, this is not a dead-end
program or web site.  As of fall 1998, we have:
<ul>
<li>A new maintenance release (<a href="boa-0.92r.tar.gz">snapshot q</a>,
 probably the last) of the 0.92 series
<li>A new e-mail address,
<a href="mailto:support@boa.org">support@boa.org</a>,
to make it easy to contact the developers.
<li>A mailing list for general Boa discussion,
<a href="mailto:discuss@boa.org">discuss@boa.org</a> (use
<a href="mailto:discuss-subscribe@boa.org">discuss-subscribe@boa.org</a>
to subscribe and 
<a href="mailto:discuss-unsubscribe@boa.org">discuss-unsubscribe@boa.org</a>
to unsubscribe).
<li>A <a href="boa-0.93.html">web site</a> for the 0.93 (development) version,
which is certainly usable, and considered part of the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Linux</a> distribution.
<li>A web site for development of internationalization efforts
(based on 0.93), in particular Czech:
<a href="http://www.cz.boa.org/">www.cz.boa.org</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server.  That means that unlike
traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
connections.  It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP
connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
processes.)  Preliminary tests show boa is about twice as fast as
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, and is capable of
handling 50 hits per <em>second</em> on a 66 MHz '486.

<p>
The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security.  Security,
in the sense of &quot;can't be subverted by a malicious user&quot;, not
&quot;fine grained access control and encrypted communications&quot;.
Boa is not intended as a feature-packed server; if you want one of those,
check out <a href="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">WN</a> from John Franks.
Modifications to Boa that improve its speed, security, robustness, and
portability, are eagerly sought.  Other features may be added if they
can be achieved without hurting the primary goals.

<p>
Boa was created by Paul Phillips &lt;psp@well.com&gt;.
It is now being maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle
&lt;ldoolitt@cebaf.gov&gt;.  Other possible contact people are
Charles F. Randall (lost), and Jon Nelson &lt;nels0988@tc.umn.edu&gt;.
Linux is the development platform at the moment, other OS's are
known to work.  If you'd like to contribute to this effort, contact
Larry or Jon via e-mail.

(many new features and generally much faster).

Are you <a href="cynical.html">cynical</a> about the idea of using Boa
