<h2>Cynical about Boa?</h2>
The cynical among you may have checked the headers, and
found out that <a href="../index.html">www.boa.org</a>
is served by Apache 1.1.3.  This is no reason for cynicism:
Russ Nelson had the ns.crynwr.com machine
set up long before he heard of Boa, and has graciously donated
space on it to give Boa a real 'net presence.  He couldn't possibly
switch to Boa until it has complete Virtual host support, which is
still lacking in release 0.92.  Even then (smart man) he makes no
promises.

<p>
The maintainers do operate Boa servers on the web, and in fact
mirror this web site there.  Check out
<ul>
<li><a href="http://recycle.cebaf.gov/boa/">recycle.cebaf.gov</a>
<li><a href="http://x183-191.reshalls.umn.edu/boa/">x183-191.reshalls.umn.edu</a>
</ul>
where you can download Boa from a working copy of Boa!
