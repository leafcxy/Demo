<title>Boa Webserver Benchmarks</title>
</head>
<body>
Right now, we just have 2 benchmarks available.
One is using zb (ZeusBench) and the other is using ab (ApacheBench).
In these 2 particular tests, the client and server are both
using rtl8139 (Realtek) chipset-based 10/100 ethernet cards,
and both happen to be using the AMD Duron 750.
<p>
In addition, both machines are every-day desktop machines, which
means that they are both running X, a half-dozen daemons including
CUPS, Samba, NFS, and others, but there is no load on them.
The network is a comprised of these machines and a 10/100 LinkSys
5 port hub.
<p>
Also, please note that because Boa is a single-threaded web server,
the load on the server never exceeded 1.00 (at least, not due
to Boa. ;-)  Running CGI would, of course, be completely different.
<p>
First, zb.
