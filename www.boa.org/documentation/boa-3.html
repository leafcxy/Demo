<P>There are many issues that become more difficult to resolve in a single 
tasking web server than in the normal forking model.  Here is a partial 
list -- there are probably many that haven't encountered yet.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="boa.html#toc3.1">Relative Performance</A>
</H2>


<P>Performance is a very difficult thing to quantitatively measure.
Due to the fact that there are very few good and accessible 
performance benchmarks, our benchmarking is limited to
very simple means.  We use the Benchmark ZeusBench, which may no longer
be available.  ZeusBench takes only a few commandline parameters, which
makes it easy to use.  It is also useful as a diagnostic tool.</P>
<P>ZeusBench has the capacity to make its requests over Ethernet as well
as localhost.  However, as bad as using localhost for anything might
well be, it *does* eliminate to a great deal the bottleneck that is
Ethernet.  As a standard rule, we use options that have ZeusBench attempt
to make either 10,000 or 20,000 successful requests.</P>
<P>The following benchmarks were run on a GNU/Linux 2.0.33 egcs 1.0.1 compiled
kernel, on an Intel Pentium 200 MMX, over localhost, and with 
a file size of 2448 bytes.  Each server was tuned with the following options:
access logging turned off, 100 keepalive, and no DNS lookups 
or unnecessary modules for Apache.</P>
<P>Like so many benchmarks, these are to be taken with a grain of salt.</P>

<P>As can be seen, Boa is significantly faster than Apache.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="boa.html#toc3.2">Limits</A>
</H2>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Slow file systems</B><DD><P>The file systems being served should be much faster than the
network connection to the HTTP requests, or performance will suffer.
For instance, if a document is served from a CD-ROM, the whole server
(including all other currently incomplete data transfers) will stall
while the CD-ROM spins up.  This is a consequence of the fact that Boa
mmap()'s each file being served, and lets the kernel read and cache
pages as best it knows how.  When the files come from a local disk
(the faster the better), this is no problem, and in fact delivers
nearly ideal performance under heavy load.  Avoid serving documents
from NFS and CD-ROM unless you have even slower inbound net
connections (e.g., POTS SLIP).</P>

<DT><B>DNS lookups</B><DD><P>Writing a nonblocking gethostbyaddr is a difficult and not very
enjoyable task.  Paul Phillips experimented with several methods, 
including a separate logging process, before removing hostname 
lookups entirely. There is a companion program with Boa 
<EM>util/resolver.pl</EM> that will postprocess the logfiles and 
replace IP addresses with hostnames, which is much faster no matter 
what sort of server you run.</P>

<DT><B>Identd lookups</B><DD><P>Same difficulties as hostname lookups; not included.
Boa provides a REMOTE_PORT environment variable, in addition
to REMOTE_ADDR, so that a CGI program can do its own ident.</P>

<DT><B>Password file lookups via NIS</B><DD><P>If users are allowed to serve HTML from their home directories,
password file lookups can potentially block the process.  To lessen
the impact, each user's home directory is cached by Boa so it need
only be looked up once.</P>

<DT><B>Running out of file descriptors</B><DD><P>Since a file descriptor is needed for every ongoing connection
(two for non-nph CGIs, directories, and automatic gunzipping of files),
it is possible though highly improbable to run out of file
descriptors.  The symptoms of this conditions may vary with
your particular unix variant, but you will probably see log
entries giving an error message for <CODE>accept</CODE>.
Try to build your kernel to give an adequate number for
your usage - GNU/Linux provides 256 out of the box, more than
enough for most people.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="boa.html#toc3.3">Differences between Boa and other web servers</A>
</H2>


<P>In the pursuit of speed and simplicity, some aspects of Boa differ
from the popular web servers.  In no particular order:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>REMOTE_HOST environment variable not set for CGI programs</B><DD><P>The REMOTE_HOST environment variable is not set for CGI programs,
for reasons already described.  This is easily worked around because the
IP address is provided in the REMOTE_ADDR variable, so (if the CGI
program actually cares) gethostbyaddr or a variant can be used.</P>

<DT><B>There are no server side includes in Boa</B><DD><P>We don't like them, and they are too slow to parse.  We will consider
more efficient alternatives, see the 
<A HREF="todo.txt">todo.txt</A> to-do list.</P>

<DT><B>There are no access control features</B><DD><P>Boa will follow symbolic links, and serve any file that it can
read.  The expectation is that you will configure Boa to run as user
"nobody", and only files configured world readable will come
out.  See the 
<A HREF="todo.txt">todo.txt</A> to-do list.</P>

<DT><B>No chroot option</B><DD><P>There is no option to run chrooted.  If anybody wants this, and is
willing to try out experimental code, contact the maintainers.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="boa.html#toc3.4">Unexpected behavior</A>
</H2>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>SIGHUP handling</B><DD><P>Like any good server, Boa traps SIGHUP and rereads <EM>boa.conf</EM>.
However, under normal circumstances, it has already given away
permissions, so many items listed in <EM>boa.conf</EM> can not take effect.
No attempt is made to change uid, gid, log files, or server port.
All other configuration changes should take place smoothly.</P>

<DT><B>Relative URL handling</B><DD><P>Not all browsers handle relative URLs correctly.  Boa will not
cover up for this browser bug, and will typically report 404 Not Found
for URL's containing odd combinations of "../"'s.</P>
</DL>
