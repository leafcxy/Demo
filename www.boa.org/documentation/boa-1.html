<P>Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server.  That means that unlike
traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
connections.  It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP
connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
processes), automatic directory generation, and automatic file
gunzipping.  Preliminary tests show Boa is capable of
handling several thousand hits per second on a 300 MHz Pentium and
dozens of hits per second on a lowly 20 MHz 386/SX.</P>
<P>The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security.  Security,
in the sense of "can't be subverted by a malicious user," not
"fine grained access control and encrypted communications".
Boa is not intended as a feature-packed server; if you want one of those,
check out 
<A HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">WN</A> from John Franks.
Modifications to Boa that improve its speed, security, robustness, and
portability, are eagerly sought.  Other features may be added if they
can be achieved without hurting the primary goals.</P>
<P>Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips
<CODE>&lt;paulp@go2net.com&gt;</CODE>.
It is now being maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle
<CODE>&lt;ldoolitt@boa.org&gt;</CODE> and Jon Nelson
<CODE>&lt;jnelson@boa.org&gt;</CODE>.
Please see the acknowledgement section for further
details.</P>
<P>GNU/Linux is the development platform at the moment, other OS's are known to work.
If you'd like to contribute to this effort, contact Larry or Jon via e-mail.</P>
