        <td>Version 0.94.14rc21 can be considered a cleanup release,
	in preparation for the final (really!) 0.94.14 copy.  If no
	problems are found, expect that final release in a week or two.
	The code now passes modern GCC on 32-bit and 64-bit
	architectures with no warnings, even with the the warning level
	turned insanely high (see GCC_FLAGS in src/Makefile.in).
        <p>
        The relevant additions to the changelog are:
        <pre>
 * shift from GNU Autoconf 2.58 to GNU Autoconf 2.59
 * increase warning level in GCC_FLAGS another notch
 * skip superfluous unsigned qualifier for char in get_alias_hash_value
 * skip check for error in umask(), since it doesn't happen
 * reorder read_config_files() and create_common_env()
 * drop incorrect preprocessor usage in TIMEZONE macro
 * make bloody sure default_type is set
 * correct error message in index_dir for .gz files
 * make mmap_cache 64-bit clean
 * try to deal with signed file offsets when using sendfile()
 * clean up signed/unsigned char issues in read_header()
 * use socklen_t where appropriate in request.c
 * call range_pool_empty() in response to SIGHUP
 * add more const qualifiers
 * eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings: change ka_timeout to signed
 * spelling fixes
 * miscellaneous whitespace changes
 * update Copyright dates
 * drop webindex.pl

        response bug found on June 8th, and a host of other small
        improvements.  A potential invalid memory access has
        also been fixed.  Lastly, the rpm spec files and support
        files have been made at least partially SuSE-aware.
        Many of the changes pertain to increasing use of
        <a href="http://www.splint.org/">splint</a>.
        <p>
        The relevant additions to the changelog are:
        <pre>
 * fix potential NULL-pointer dereference in hash_insert, introduced
   in 0.94.14rc16.
 * try to make SuSE-ready:
   rpm/{boa.init, boa.init-redhat, boa.init-suse, boa.spec}
 * use S_ISREG combined with access(2) rather than
   using the statbuf stuff to determine if a cgi is accessible
 * optionally #define EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS, and use them
   everywhere.
 * mark a few variables and functions 'static'
 * use %u instead of %d when printing an unsigned int
 * mmap returns void * not char *
 * change access_node->type to an enum
 * make boa.h #include 'config.h' *first*
 * use -1 instead of ULONG_MAX (that way, if the datatype ever changes,
   we always get it's maximum)
 * fix bug in multiple non-contiguous range requests for files that
   use sendfile(2)
 * reduce some noise if a request in a keepalive chain is shut down
   without having read a single byte.
 * fix potential memory access bug in hashing
 * update config.sub and config.guess to the latest available
 * use CHANGES not ChangeLog

        <td>Version 0.94.14rc19 fixes some multi-range responses,
        and adds a few otherwise minor detail changes and feature
        improvements.  Most of the items below are general code
        readability improvements or refactoring. The only bugfixes in
        this release pertain to multi-part range responses, and one
        very small bug (Boa was being a bit too pedantic) regarding
        blank header values in headers; Boa now accepts the empty
        header value silently.

        <p>
        The relevant additions to the changelog are:
        <pre>
 * change many instances of log_error_mesg + send_r_error to boa_perror
 * set timezone right away at program startup
 * add new_clean_pathname from now-defunct 0.95 branch
   (unused via #if 0)
 * change common_cgi_env to be dynamically sized, using realloc.
 * add new keyword, CGIEnv, which takes 2 parameters and adds them as
   the key and value of another common environment variable for CGI.
   This item requires the previous change.
 * split modified_since into 2 routines:
   date_to_tm, which parses various date formats into a 'struct tm', and
   modified_since, which then just compares the struct tm to the
    items from a statbuf.
 * remove fake status codes R_413 and R_415, and manually set
   R_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG to 414 and R_INVALID_RANGE to 416
 * move CRLF macro definition to defines.h
 * use CRLF macro everywhere
 * don't print content-length in print_partial_content_continue
 * remove extra CRLF in print_partial_content_done
 * *do* print content-length in 206 response's "primary" headers IFF There
   is only 1 range.
 * move CRLF in 206 *after* to the print_partial_content_continue
 * in 503, remove \r from the human-readable message.
 * #define and use CRLF macro, fix some tabs/spaces issues
 * in date_to_tm, use 70 not 50 as the cutoff date (makes sense, 1970)
 * adapt some code from Squid to return -1 in date_to_tm on invalid dates
   (seconds > 59, etc...)
 * implement ConcealServerIdentity
 * treat headers with blank content as non-error but do not parse them

          This is 0.94.14rc18.  This is a cleanup release, and is the
          result of continuing efforts to clean and improve the code.  It
          is likely that the most important change is the last,
          pertaining to multipart range responses.  I got the order of
          some responses wrong.
          <p>
          The relevant additions to the changelog are:
          <pre>
 * add log_error_mesg_fatal, which does log_error_mesg and then exits
 * fix malloc thinko in buffer code
 * use ULONG_MAX instead of -1 to describe unbounded ranges
 * log '-' instead of req->logline if req->logline is undefined
 * remove some superflous send_r_error statements.
 * fix a logic inversion regarding QUIET_DISCONNECT
 * move rate limit code very slightly, and force http version of 1.0
 * move req->ka_count decrement out of sanitize_request
 * /always/ issue log_access in free_request
 * use BOA_FD_CLR to clear file descriptors out of the FD_SETs that
   they might be in.
 * disable keepalive when response status is 0 or >= 500
 * update a comment regarding the 100 Continue response
 * use BOA_READ and BOA_WRITE macros in select.c
 * backport (but leave it commented out) USE_SETRLIMIT stuff for cgi's
 * backport DEBUG debugging and logging code
   disable with --disable-verbose (worth about 4K of binary size)
 * split out usage and parsing commandline tasks into their own functions
   (usage and parse_commandline)
 * in poll.c, don't just check for BOA_READ, but handle all "error"
   conditions first, then check for /any/ revent.
 * force response code to 400 when client closes connection before request
   is fully read.
 * use code 408 to indicate timed-out response
 * use isalnum instead of isalpha to verify hostname as per Alan's
   suggestion
 * fix 2 copy-and-paste error messages in mmap_cache.c (error message
   was wrong)
 * add and use TIMED_OUT state for requests that time out.
 * reset signals (in child process) after forking for CGI
 * fix multipart range responses

An segmentation fault problem was discovered that could be triggered
from the network, causing a Denial of Service.  We do not think this is
normally exploitable outside of a DoS.  There are a few minor fixes and
improvements as well, but all users of the 0.94.14rc series should
upgrade to 0.94.14rc15 as soon as possible.

   just warn, also close it down and place on the free list.
 * use log_error_doc in some places instead of log_error_time
 * clean up logline parsing.  This fixes a potential sigseg!

 * fix use of HAVE_FUNC
 * if FD_SETSIZE is undefined, set MAX_FD to OPEN_MAX instead of
   arbitarily setting it to 2048.

 * give Boa more breathing room WRT MaxConnections and total current
   connections -- currently simply set at 20.

   be checked.

   NI_MAXHOST is defined for IPv6
 * when we can't mmap a file, fall back to IOSHUFFLE.  If we couldn't
   mmap the file due to an error in mmap or madvise, report the error,
   otherwise it is safe to assume we simply ran out of hash table space.
 * The following 2 changes borrowed from Hydra (which is itself
   based on Boa):
   * Some optimizations in HTTP header parsing.
   * Added DefaultCharset configuration directive. The default
     character set given, will be appended to all text mime types.
 * update boa.texi with some missing configuration directives

<pre>
 * change to using PF_ prefix instead of AF_ prefix (PF_ is POSIX?)
 * fix copying too-much-memory (read-side, write-side was OK) in
   ascii_sockaddr.  Also optimize slightly (note, may actually be a wee
   slower due to strlen check -- is there a way around this?)
 * fix a few shadow variable problems and improve select and poll loops
 * check for and use madvise (may or may not help)
 * update depends (the cause of SIGSEGs when ./configure was re-run to
   switch from select to poll, *without* running make clean)
 * always remove select.o and poll.o (and access.o) because these are
   the usual conditional files.
 * if we aren't using IPv6, define BOA_NI_MAXHOST to 20. 1025 is
   far too huge for a single IPv4 IP address in dotted-quad notation.
 * move access_init to earlier in the config reading
 * allow a MAX_FILE_MMAP value of 0 to mean "always mmap"

   say silently shut it down and don't be noisy about logging it.
 * wrap sa_family_t typedef in
   #ifdef DONT_HAVE_SA_FAMILY_T

<pre>
** Changes from 0.94.13 to 0.94.14
 * SUBSTANTIALLY UPDATE AUTOCONF SYSTEM
   - all of the autoconf stuff is now located in the top level
     directory, and creates the appropriate Makefiles for building
     the system and documentation.
 * add [optional, Linux-only] check for sendfile system call
 * add new state, IOSHUFFLE, which utilizes sendfile (or
   emulates it using the request's buffer, otherwise)
 * make the default socket size 32K.  The client_stream_size stays constant
   at 8K, and the new 'buffer' size is 4K
   Note also that the new code uses the "default" socket buffer size
   it obtains with the first accept()ed socket.
 * use setjmp, instead of sigsetjmp (we dont mess with the signal mask
   so why bother!  it's one less syscall)
 * explicitly set pending_requests to 0 in select.c when sigterm_flag has
   been set, and also when the server socket is *not* set despite checking
   for it.
 * make default behavior be to leave stderr alone, but tie it
   to cgilog otherwise
 * add initial vhost_root support
 * remove support for normalize_path
 * use --disable-sendfile to disable sendfile support
   sendfile support for files &gt; 100K is default, now.
   It's significantly faster and easier than the alternative
 * add "Host" header support to CGI environment
 * umask ~0770 before exec
 * backport hash.c from 0.95 and use fnv1a hash (see CREDITS)
 * don't set stderr close-on-exec
 * make some minor for very useful optimizations in the read/write
   loop for CGIs
 * make some adjustments for Solaris and other platforms
 * add yyerror function definition to boa_lexer.l
 * tie stdout to the access_log, unless there is no access_log,
   in which case tie it to /dev/null
 * use sensible defaults for umask (077) and (027 for CGI)
 * add and document new parameters (CGILog and CGIumask)
 * vast improvements to the cgi-test.cgi program, by Jon Nelson
   and Landon Curt Noll.
 * next 3 items by Don Mahurin (patches modified somewhat):
 * pidfile patch
 * default mime_types patch
 * NCSA environment environment variables wrapped in
   #ifdef USE_NCSA_CGI_ENV
 * fix some escaping issues with the directory indexer
   (Ulf Harnhammar)
 * backport poll support from 0.95

 * fix really lame thinko in normalize_path, which would prepend the
   results of earlier calls to results from later calls
 * Add MaxConnections, a configuration directive which allows the
   user to specify the maximum number of connections that Boa will
   accept concurrently.
 * add SERVER_ADDR and REQUEST_URI to environment of CGI
 * handle SIGBUS during writes of data that has been memory mapped
 * minor optimization in select.c that prevents DEAD requests from
   being added to the block set
 * fix bug in CGI environment script_name - closes sf.net bug #576725
 * make 'status' variable local to requests.c, not local to every file
   by forgetting to declare 'extern' in globals.h :-|
 * make getsockname non-fatal, and do it every time because we may
   need it for the CGI
 * some minor refactoring optimizations in hash.c

          There is only 1 difference between 0.94.12rc6 and
          0.94.12rc7, and it has to deal with making sure alias
          matching is very consistent. When matching an url to an
          alias, Boa will match the entire 'virtual' part of the
          alias. Additionally, if the 'real' part of the alias does
          not end in '/', the first character after the matched
          part of the url must be either '/' or '\0' - allowing
          '/foo' to match both '/foo' and '/foo/' but not
          '/foobar'<br>

 * tie stderr to either cgi_log_fd or devnullfd - either way
   make sure stderr is a valid filehandle before cgi execution
 * cgi_env is no longer allocated, it's part of the struct now

           The ChangeLog entries since 0.94.12rc4 are as follows:
<pre>
 * add function boa_atoi, which wraps atoi, but does not
   accept negative values. Additionally, it checks to make sure
   the converted value and the original value are the same, avoiding
   issues like "124.3" -&gt; "123" and "123abc" -=&gt; "123".
   Either a value is an int or it isn't - no middle ground.
 * use boa_atoi to convert content-length from client.
 * add new #define - SINGLE_POST_LIMIT_DEFAULT, which defines
   (in bytes) the *default* single_post_limit.
 * single_post_limit is now in bytes.
 * when adding aliases, only "normalize" paths that start
   with "./" - this is a departure from previous behavior
 * add "?" to the list of characters that it is safe to leave unescaped

          Most of the updates to 0.94.12rc2 are fairly minor, and
          primarily help compilation on Solaris. Also, some signal
          handlers were improved, and the select loop is now in
          select.c, helping abstraction. Additionally, unless
          ORIGINAL_BEHAVIOR is #defined, Boa will now poll the
          server socket once per active connection until there are
          no more waiting requests. This should have two effects -
          a **very** slightly greater latency (if it is measured at
          all), but a **much** more consistent latency. Finally,
          Boa now tells clients that it is too busy, although in
          practical terms, this is not very likely to happen, due
          to various factors.<br>
           The ChangeLog entries since 0.94.12rc2 are as follows:
<pre>
 * try to make NOBLOCK handling in compat.h compatible with Solaris
 * make sure to update current_time before calling signal handlers
 * alter primary loop to make sure that select gets called even
   when there are requests that are not blocking, and call fdset_update
   and process_requests (when appropriate) after signal handlers but
   before select to make sure that blocked requests are still handled
   by select after a sighup. (Thanks to Karl Olsen)
 * pull select loop into select.c
 * poll server socket once per active connection
 * add send_r_service_unavailable and use it when appropriate
 * state uptime in seconds at normal program termination
 * include sys/fcntl.h if it is found by configure

          0.94.11.1). The ChangeLog entries since 0.94.12rc1 are as
          follows:
<pre>
 * add some new hash routines, and use djb2 (a variant on a
   hash alrogithm popularized by Dan J. Bernstein)
 * a side-effect of the new hash routines is a bugfix,
   involving negative return values from hash routines.
   This has been fixed.
 * add a routine, show_hash_stats, which is called with other
   statistical output via sigalarm
 * remove some duplicate prototypes from config.c
 * make simple_itoa take an unsigned int

         Versions 0.94.12pre2 and 0.94.12pre1 had some minor bugs
        (and one show-stopper, regarding CGI) that 0.94.11 did not
        have. The changes between 0.94.12pre2 and 0.94.12pre3
        include an updated .depend file, elimination of the lame
        MAINTAINER stuff in the Makefile, using fcntl + GET_FL to
        get a file descriptor's flags *before* setting or unsetting
        the fd's bits, making sure we call FD_ZERO on restart, and
        a few other minor improvements.<br>
         The reason for the pre-releases is that there are quite a
        few changes in this release, and while most are geared
        towards better platform compatability (specifically, *BSD
        and Solaris), there are a few minor bugfixes as well.</td>
